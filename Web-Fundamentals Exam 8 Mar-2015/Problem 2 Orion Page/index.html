					<h2>ORION</h2>
					<h4>The Hunter</h4>
					<p>There are two different versions of the Orion myth, depending on the identity of his parents.
					The first of these identifies the sea-god Neptune as Orion's father and the the great huntress
					Queen Euryale of the Amazons as his mother. Orion inherited her talent, and became the greatest
					hunter in the world. Unfortunately for him, with his immense strength came an immense ego, and he
					boasted that he could best any animal on earth. In response to his vanity, a single small scorpion stung
					him and killed him.</p>
					<p>Another version of the Orion myth states that he had no mother but was a gift to a pious peasant
					from Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury. <strong><i>"Orion supposedly was able to walk on water and had greater
					strength and stature than any other mortal. A skilled blacksmith, he fabricated a subterranean palace for
					Vulcan. He also walled in the coasts of Sicily against the encroaching sea and built a temple to
					the gods there" (Magee, 48).</i></strong></p>
